## 🔍 What Was Wrong?

Your `mcp-server.js` had **3 CRITICAL BUGS**:

1. ❌ **Duplicate API endpoints** (same route defined 3x)
2. ❌ **Body size limit too small** (100kb - images are 2MB+)
3. ❌ **No error logging** (impossible to debug)

**Result:** Chat and Symptom Tracker failed silently with no error messages.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed?

I created `mcp-server-fixed.js` with:

1. ✅ **Removed all duplicates** - Each endpoint defined ONCE
2. ✅ **Increased limit to 50mb** - Now handles large images
3. ✅ **Added console.log everywhere** - You can see what's happening
4. ✅ **Added error details** - Know exactly what went wrong
5. ✅ **Consistent Gemini model** - All using `gemini-2.5-flash`

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### **Check These:**

1. **Server Running?**
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :4000
   ```
   Should show a process

2. **Browser Console (F12):**
   - Look for red errors
   - Check Network tab

3. **Server Console:**
   - Should show "Chat request received"
   - If not, request isn't reaching server

4. **Gemini API Key:**
   - Test at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Make sure key is active
